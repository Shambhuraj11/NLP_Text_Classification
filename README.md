## NLP_Text_Classification


This is my first repository where i tried to use my entry level knowledge of NLP.

In this repository I took textual data, did preprocessing over it which involves: 
1. Punctuation removal
2. tokenization 
3. removing stopwords
4. Applying Lemmatization 
with help of nltk-packages

In this respository i did text classification by using many machine learing classification algorithmns like:
 1. Naive Bayes 
 2. Logistic Regression
 3. Support Vector Machine
 4. Random Forest

 I tried to achieve accuracy up to 83%
