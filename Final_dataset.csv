198,1,one thing drive continues toward exchangelisted fund trust sector there also key debate technical area future cryptocurrencies found proofofstake protocol
199,1,proofofwork versus proofofstake issue come question ensure integrity cryptocurrency legacy cryptocurrencies bitcoin rely proofofwork mechanism see image thousand computer mining facility thats proofofwork operation computer solve complicated algorithmic puzzle return miner receive token underlying cryptocurrency reward
200,1,proofofstake contrast relies validators maintain cryptocurrency proofofstake model owner put token collateral return get authority token proportion amount stake generally token stakers get additional ownership token time via network fee newly minted token reward mechanism
201,0,beginning proofofwork appealing people needed ordinary computer mine coin nowadays however specialized expensive gear needed mine leading proofofwork token much mining done large wellfinanced pool cut general public equation
202,1,debate proofofstake versus proofofwork battle former could democratic anyone token able participate validator staker tap decentralized finance defi ecosystem broadly analyst focused environmental burden proofofwork protocol bitcoin particular developed large environmental footprint gained wider adoption proofofstake cutting advanced cryptographic puzzle reduces environmental cost dramatically
203,1,proofofwork advocate protest proofofstake deviate original vision cryptocurrency bitcoin differentiated financial asset database blockchain record inherently valuable mining process inefficient term energy created distinct tamperproof record financial transaction proofofstake least basic form vulnerability
204,0,nothing stake problem example centered around fact cost creating fork putting bad information consensus encourages malicious behavior proofofworks energy cost inherently limit manipulation proofofstake contrast must use sophisticated method try stop security issue
205,0,proofofstake versus proofofwork debate largely stayed within technical realm proofofstake notable leader cardano biggest project stayed proofofwork however ethereums plan migrate proofofwork proofofstake bringing subject spotlight ethereums move began earnest 2020 ethereum launched proofofstake beacon chain development continues phase 1 aiming launch later 2021 full merge proofofstake ethereum happening next year
206,0,given benefit proofofstake ethereum taken long make switch main impediment faster adoption proofofstake certainly difficulty migrating largest smart contract network ethereum proofofwork proofofstake say justin giudici head product telos foundation challenge changing consensus mechanism ethereum compared fixing plane flying thousand existing smart contract ethereum chain along billion dollar asset stake migration challenge significant
207,1,number put challenge perspective development ethereum far outpaced ability change thus scale easy understand consider defi phenomenon saw industry go zero 76 billion last year first two quarter 2021 nonfungible token exploded bringing 25 billion building ethereum network happening explosive rate switch proofofwork proofofstake long arduous process say david waslen ceo rublix development blockchain smart contract software company
208,1,easy migrate one technology another vacuum however ethereums decentralized finance system already gained wide adoption vital maintain continuous network stability could unexpected critical bug circumstance difficult predict merge occurs good reason rushing transition say mattias nystrom community manager golem network
209,1,ethereums timeline seen product strength decentralization complex project lot stakeholder beyond censorship resistant permissionless socially mean anyone join project give input change network need consensus among developer creating code among wider community thing progress nystrom say
210,1,another factor recent decline cryptocurrency price ensuing amount mining power devoted proofofwork protocol transaction fee bitcoin ethereum leading proofofwork project support mining network crypto dropped transaction fee fell even average transaction fee drop say 25 5 still huge cut smaller decentralized finance transaction

219,0,bureaucracy heavily invested expertise importance local regulation standard extremely difficult cut gordian knot implement seamless global system
220,1,keep trying reinject point control thus point vulnerability blockchains eg permissioning nullifies main benefit come removing point vulnerability
221,0,szabo reiterated point remove vulnerability bank also remove individual human control individual charge root access bank naturally hate loss power dont choice want gain benefit army independent computer rigorously constantly securely check others work said
222,1,szabo pointed proper financial control already somewhat decentralised thanks human blockchain accountant auditor etc checking others work
223,1,half dozen different entity involved stock trade wall street checking others work typically see full vulnerability unaccountable third party pathological situation naive newcomer try money centralised web mtgox
224,0,traditional human blockchain laborintensive local — based local regulation custom thus split world mutually untrusting national silo permissionless blockchains cut like alexander cutting gordian knot
225,0,szabo deep understanding way legal contract auditing system work applied computing logic area famously coining term smart contract back 1990s
226,1,ibtimes asked szabo expected smart contract execution decentralised apps censorshipresistant system like ethereum challenge financial legal institution ferocity similar bitcoin
227,1,yes eventually moreso since ethereums flexible general language facilitate much wider variety commercial formal relationship
228,1,however ethereum community need learn reverseengineer legal traditional pattern instead trying reinvent society scratch take time figure well also take time ethereum platform technologically mature bitcoin
229,1,financial contract clearlydefined rule collateralised generally viewed lowhanging fruit within brave new world smart contract recently ubs came bush smart bond platform built ethereum
230,1,szabo said bond good example financial instrument suited smart contract could backed asset exist blockchain bond issuer fails make payment
231,0,secured collateral controlled digitally blockchain trustminimised automated kind interaction
232,0,performed predominantly dry code interpreted computer rather lawyer thus automated trustminimised vulnerabilityminimised seamless operation across border

235,1,bitcoin transaction volume expected increase year ahead debate increase headroom size block currently limited 1mb headline recently
236,0,szabo favour blockstream cofounder pieter wuilles proposal securityconscious approach using limitingresource figure scenario argues 20 le per year increase block size
237,0,szabo provided analogy box size debate number dollar bill could fitted armoured car one side debate say try carry many piece paper truck possible order allow handle small denomination want turn armoured car big moving van said szabo
238,1,side argues truck smaller heavily armoured move dollar bill moving van much like visa many transaction per second bitcoin remove armour — reduce security
239,1,youd hire security guard moneycounters instead youd depend local law protect block size box size moneycarrying truck security v performance tradeoff
240,1,reduce redundancy message allow larger block size beyond growth limitingresource technology reduces automated integrity make bitcoin distinctive financial
241,0,creates avenue attack would end becoming dependent human blockchain accountant investigator lawyer integrity would labourintensive nationally siloed like traditional system
242,1,visa paypal much higher transaction per second bitcoin analogous szabos bigger truck moving dollar bill labourintensive often difficult use across national border
243,1,thats tradeoff want make visa paypal already exist within national border quite well silly try turn bitcoin yet another visa paypal said
244,1,mean largeb bitcoin blockchain evolve highvalue settlement system grows wont turn big moving van carrying many piece paper transaction per second instead armoured car carry higher denomination higher value per transaction mean need system smallb bitcoin currency retail payment
245,1,completely reasonable even bitcoin currency purist wouldnt like credit debit card payment denominated bitcoin rather dollar net settled bitcoin instead fedwire

288,1,onset information age nation becoming increasingly dependent upon network communication computerbased technology significantly impacting ability access store distribute information among important us technology electronic commerce performing financial transaction via electronic information exchanged telecommunication line key requirement electronic commerce development secure efficient electronic payment system need security highlighted rise internet promise leading medium future electronic commerce
289,1,type electronic payment system focused paper electronic cash name implies electronic cash attempt construct electronic payment system modelled paper cash system paper cash feature portable easily carried recognizable legal tender hence readily acceptable transferable without involvement financial network untraceable record money spent anonymous record spent money ability make change designer electronic cash focused preserving feature untraceability anonymity thus electronic cash defined electronic payment system provides addition security feature property user anonymity payment untraceability
290,1,general electronic cash scheme achieve security goal via digital signature considered digital analog handwritten signature digital signature based public key cryptography cryptosystem user secret key public key secret key used create digital signature public key needed verify digital signature tell signed information also called message one must certain one know owns given public key problem key management solution requires kind authentication infrastructure addition system must adequate network physical security safeguard secrecy secret key
291,1,report surveyed academic literature cryptographic technique implementing secure electronic cash system several innovative payment scheme providing user anonymity payment untraceability found although particular payment system thoroughly analyzed cryptography appears sound deliver promised anonymity
292,1,scheme far le satisfactory however law enforcement point view particular danger money laundering counterfeiting potentially far serious paper cash problem exist electronic payment system made much worse presence anonymity indeed widespread use electronic cash would increase vulnerability national financial system information warfare attack discus measure manage risk step however would effect limiting user anonymity
293,1,report organized following manner chapter 1 defines basic concept surrounding electronic payment system electronic cash chapter 2 provides reader high level cryptographic description electronic cash protocol term basic authentication mechanism chapter 3 technically describes specific implementation proposed academic literature chapter 4 optional feature transferability divisibility offline electronic cash presented finally chapter 5 security issue associated electronic cash discussed
294,0,author paper wish acknowledge following people contribution research effort numerous discussion review paper kevin igoe john petro steve neal mel currie
295,1,begin carefully defining electronic cash term often applied electronic payment scheme superficially resembles cash user fact however electronic cash specific kind electronic payment scheme defined certain cryptographic property focus property
296,1,term electronic commerce refers financial transaction involving electronic transmission information packet information transmitted commonly called electronic token one confuse token sequence bit physical medium used store transmit information
297,1,refer storage medium card since commonly take form walletsized card made plastic cardboard two obvious example credit card atm card however card could also eg computer memory
298,0,particular kind electronic commerce electronic payment electronic payment protocol series transaction end payment made using token issued third party common example credit card electronic approval process used note definition implies neither payer payee issue tokenl
299,1,rise telecommunication internet increasingly case electronic commerce take place using transmission medium control financial system therefore necessary take step insure security message sent along medium
300,1,key management carried using certification authority trusted agent responsible confirming user identity done user including bank issued digital identity certificate certificate used whenever user wish identify another user addition certificate make possible set private key user secure authenticated way private key used encrypt subsequent message technique implemented provide security feature
301,0,although authentication infrastructure may separate electroniccommerce setup security essential component security electroniccommerce system without trusted certification authority secure infrastructure four security feature achieved electronic commerce becomes impossible untrusted transmission medium
302,0,feature available credit card indeed conventional payment system offering cash thus chaum others introduced electronic cash digital cash electronic payment system offer feature sequence event electronic cash payment follows
303,0,note online system payment deposit separate step refer online cash offline cash scheme omitting word electronic since danger confusion paper cash
304,1,payment system potential criminal abuse intention either cheating financial system using payment mechanism facilitate crime discus problem 5 however issue counterfeiting must considered since payment protocol contain builtin protection
305,1,one deal counterfeiting trying prevent happening trying detect fact way identifies culprit prevention clearly preferable thing equal
306,0,although tempting imagine electronic cash system transmission storage medium secure certainly application case obvious example internet whose user notoriously vulnerable virus eavesdropping thus need technique dealing counterfeiting physical security
307,1,feature authenticity anonymity multiplespender exposure achieved conveniently using publickey cryptography discus done next two chapter
308,1,chapter give highlevel description electronic cash protocol term basic authentication mechanism begin describing mechanism based publickey cryptography build protocol gradually ease exposition start simplified scheme provides anonymity incorporate payment untraceability feature finally payment anonymity property result complete electronic cash protocol
309,0,oneway function oneway function correspondence two set computed efficiently one direction word function phi oneway given domain phi easy compute phi given hard find element typically number could also eg point elliptic curve see 10
310,0,key pair phi oneway function key pair pair related way via phi call secret key public key name imply user keep secret key make public key available secret key remains secret even public key known oneway property phi insures computed
311,1,publickey protocol use key pair reason publickey cryptography often called asymmetric cryptography conventional cryptography often called symmetric cryptography since one encrypt decrypt private key neither without
312,0,signature identification public key system user identifies proving know secret key without revealing done performing operation using secret key anyone check undo using public key called identification one us message well one secret key one performing digital signature message digital signature play role handwritten signature identifying author message way repudiated confirming integrity message
313,0,secure hashing hash function map possible string bit length bit string fixed length function often required collisionfree must computationally difficult find two input hash value hash function oneway collisionfree said secure hash
314,1,common use secure hash function digital signature message might come size given publickey algorithm requires working set fixed size thus one hash message sign secure hash rather message hash required oneway prevent signature forgery ie constructing validlooking signature message without using secret key4 hash must collisionfree prevent repudiation ie denying signed one message producing another message hash
315,1,4 note token forgery thing signature forgery forging bank digital signature without knowing secret key one way committing token forgery way bank employee hacker instance could borrow bank secret key validly sign token key compromise scenario discussed 53
316,1,5 one keep mind term bank refers financial system issue clear coin example bank might credit card company overall banking system latter case alice bob might separate bank deposit procedure little complicated bob bank contact alices bank cash coin put money bob account
317,0,protocol use digital signature achieve authenticity authenticity feature could achieved way need use digital signature allow anonymity mechanism add
318,0,section modify protocol include payment untraceability necessary bank able link specific withdrawal specific deposit6 accomplished using special kind digital signature called blind signature
319,0,give example blind signature 32 give highlevel description withdrawal step user change message signed using random quantity step called blinding coin random quantity called blinding factor bank sign randomlooking text user remove blinding factor user legitimate electronic coin signed bank bank see coin submitted deposit know withdrew since random blinding factor unknown bank obviously longer possible checking withdrawal record optional step first two protocol
320,0,note bank know signing withdrawal step introduces possibility bank might signing something intending sign prevent specify bank digital signature given secret key valid authorizing withdrawal fixed amount example bank could one key 10 withdrawal another 50 withdrawal on7
321,0,7 0ne could also broaden concept blind signature include interactive protocol party contribute random element message signed example randomized blind signature occurring ferguson scheme discussed 33
322,0,turn much ask way scenario consumer obtain signed receipt thus forced settle payer anonymity
323,0,payment online use protocol 3 implemented course allow payer anonymity offline case however new problem arises merchant try deposit previously spent coin turned bank neither know multiple spender since anonymous thus necessary bank able identify multiple spender feature however preserve anonymity lawabiding user
324,1,solution payment step require payer addition electronic coin sort identifying information share payee information split way one piece reveals nothing alices identity two piece sufficient fully identify
325,1,information created withdrawal step withdrawal protocol includes step bank verifies information corresponds alice particular coin created preserve payer anonymity bank actually see information verify alice carry information along coin spends
326,1,payment step alice must reveal one piece information bob thus alice spend coin since know information revealing done using challengeresponse protocol protocol bob sends alice random challenge quantity response alice return piece identifying information challenge quantity determines piece sends deposit step revealed piece sent bank along coin go identifying information never point alice however spend coin twice bank eventually obtain two copy coin piece identifying information randomness challengeresponse protocol two piece different thus bank able identify multiple spender since dispense identifying information know coin copied respent someone else
327,1,note protocol bob must verify bank signature giving alice merchandise way bob sure either paid learn alices identity multiple spender
328,0,described electronic cash highlevel way wish describe specific implementation proposed literature implementation offline case online protocol simplification first step discus various implementation publickey cryptographic tool described earlier
329,0,must first specific include access necessary identifying information meant catch multiple spender two way cutandchoose method zeroknowledge proof
330,0,cut choose alice wish make withdrawal first construct blind message consisting k pair number k large enough event probability 2k never happen practice number property one identify alice given piece pair unmatched piece useless obtains signature blinded message bank done way bank check k pair number present required property despite blinding
331,0,alice spends coin bob challenge string k random bit bit alice sends appropriate piece corresponding pair example bit string start 0110 alice sends first piece first pair second piece second pair second piece third pair first piece fourth pair etc bob deposit coin bank sends k piece
332,0,alice respends coin challenged second time since challenge random bit string new challenge bound disagree old one least one bit thus alice reveal piece corresponding pair bank receives coin second time take two piece combine reveal alices identity
333,1,zeroknowledge proof term zeroknowledge proof refers protocol publickey cryptography prof knowledge quantity without revealing making easier find case alice creates key pair secret key point identity done way bank check via public key secret key fact reveals identity despite blinding payment protocol give bob public key part electronic coin prof bob via zeroknowledge proof posse corresponding secret key responds two distinct challenge identifying information put together reveal secret key identity
334,0,next step describe digital signature used implementation protocol technique used include identifying information
335,1,two kind digital signature kind appear electronic cash protocol suppose signer key pair message signed

733,1,jon matonis enjoyed blog post market force fractional reserve banking consider fractional reserve banking compatible austrian economics
734,1,peter šurda first would like separate fractional reserve banking credit expansion one hand way increasing money supply broader sense require fractional reserve banking change monetary base system based principle mutual credit like let local exchange trading system fiat currency us bitcoin reserve ie claim sense ludwig von mi us act full substitute opposite direction fractional reserve banking necessarily lead credit expansion
735,0,think economic legal analysis two separate issue need addressed separately avoided legal analysis thesis concentrated austrian business cycle theory policy issue earlier draft several page legal aspect discussed topic legal theorist stephan kinsella
736,0,peter šurda austrian made argument past lead conclusion fractional reserve banking necessarily lead credit expansion even though never explicitly formulated way might realized connection reason credit instrument decrease transaction cost monetary base unlikely act part money supply bitcoin show hypothetical empirically possible implement bitcoin much le likely credit expansion occur
737,1,word need separate two thing people want hold fractional reserve banking instrument may include interest payment one reason people want use fractional reserve banking instrument medium exchange argue requires fractional reserve banking instrument decrease transaction cost historically manifested common instrument empirical quirk economic rule ability loan money beneficial contrary many austrian agree maturity transformation beneficial loan end liquid instrument also beneficial liquid becomes part money supply thats detrimental effect economy
738,1,full reservist bitcoin show question fractional reserve banking le important thought fractional reservist hand need think nature mechanism equilibrating money supply tried explain issue economist george selgin david glasner comment website wasnt successful getting point

742,0,peter šurda hypothetically reserve offline substitute clearing system like ripple possibility understand point correctly offline substitute might higher chance actually becoming full substitute might obvious advantage
743,0,jon matonis recent block chain fork episode demonstrates need offline bitcoin transaction continue demand sufficient money substitute evolve offline substitute full partial bitcoin backing
744,1,peter šurda primarily empirical question cant completely sure think probability significantly lower currency weve known historically end result also pathdependent instance depends quickly bitcoin matures andor adapts change compared potential substitute
745,1,fractional reserve banking come existence magically must follow economic rule gold similar commodity fractional reserve banking come existence reason demand side demand money substitute provide something money proper supply side money substitute carry maintenance cost issuer eg storage gold need offset somehow issuer charge holding eg demurrage bank note transacting eg check clearing obviously externalize cost fractional reserve point view individual user fractional reserve banking appears least costly alternative obviously fractional reserve banking win
746,1,putting together general demand money substitute lead fractional reserve banking unless illegal might solution money lead creation money substitute bitcoin show least hypothetically possible might even go bit make statement free market money substitute develop even though legal technical obstacle mean choice money paretooptimal since change monetary system lead increase utility
747,1,jon matonis demand positive return bitcoin balance lead environment competitive bank lending riskadjusted interest rate lead environment fractional reserve banking depositor offered higher interest rate exchange additional risk premium running fractional portfolio
748,1,peter šurda yes would say industry niche primarily use bitcoin probably much different gambling
749,0,might lead negotiable credit instrument maturitymismatching maturity transformation depending economic school use terminology however dont think feature alone sufficient instrument accepted full substitute whereas george selgin appears think whether call situation fractional reserve banking even though credit expansion occurs unclear lean towards yes could interpretation
750,1,peter šurda using bitcoin loan make sense business use bitcoin unit account unless course youre speculating market dont actually sell good service think occur much higher level liquidity quite sure deserves label money higher level liquidity reached price bitcoin probably quite volatile reduces likelihood people use unit account
751,1,however could niche market segment use bitcoin primary medium exchange bitcoin mining obvious candidate unit account function would make sense even global market penetration lower
752,1,assuming one threshold crossed money supply remains inelastic ie significant credit expansion interest rate bitcoin good reflection time preference market participant use unit account bitcoin also make much easier lending occur decentralized manner think rather small number big fail institution see smaller specialized team act facilitator without owning liability liable
753,1,jon matonis free market fractional reserve system opposed central banking fractional reserve system coexist full reserve banking one drive
754,1,peter šurda think money substitute emerge fractional reserve banking outcompete 100 reserve banking market deal bit earlier draft thesis dont emerge hand well money supply equivalent monetary base debt cause change money supply would viewed merely highly liquid credit dont think coexist long time assuming underlying money narrower sense course

764,0,imagine company owns server farm 10000 computer used maintain database holding client ’ account information company owns warehouse building contains computer one roof full control computer information contained within however provides single point failure happens electricity location go internet connection severed burn ground bad actor era everything single keystroke case data lost corrupted
765,1,blockchain allow data held database spread among several network node various location creates redundancy also maintains fidelity data stored therein—if somebody try alter record one instance database node would altered thus would prevent bad actor one user tamper bitcoin ’ record transaction node would crossreference easily pinpoint node incorrect information system help establish exact transparent order event way single node within network alter information held within
766,1,information history transaction cryptocurrency irreversible record could list transaction cryptocurrency also possible blockchain hold variety information like legal contract state identification company ’ product inventory
767,1,decentralized nature bitcoin ’ blockchain transaction transparently viewed either personal node using blockchain explorer allow anyone see transaction occurring live node copy chain get updated fresh block confirmed added mean wanted could track bitcoin wherever go
768,1,example exchange hacked past kept bitcoin exchange lost everything hacker may entirely anonymous bitcoins extracted easily traceable bitcoins stolen hack moved spent somewhere would known
769,1,course record stored bitcoin blockchain well others encrypted mean owner record decrypt reveal identity using publicprivate key pair result user blockchains remain anonymous preserving transparency
770,1,blockchain technology achieves decentralized security trust several way begin new block always stored linearly chronologically always added “ end ” blockchain block added end blockchain extremely difficult go back alter content block unless majority network reached consensus ’ block contains hash along hash block well previously mentioned timestamp hash code created mathematical function turn digital information string number letter information edited way hash code change well
771,1,let ’ say hacker also run node blockchain network want alter blockchain steal cryptocurrency everyone else alter single copy would longer align everyone else ’ copy everyone else crossreferences copy would see one copy stand hacker ’ version chain would cast away illegitimate
772,1,succeeding hack would require hacker simultaneously control alter 51 copy blockchain new copy becomes majority copy thus agreedupon chain attack would also require immense amount money resource would need redo block would different timestamps hash code
773,1,due size many cryptocurrency network fast growing cost pull feat probably would insurmountable would extremely expensive also likely fruitless thing would go unnoticed network member would see drastic alteration blockchain network member would hard fork new version chain affected would cause attacked version token plummet value making attack ultimately pointless bad actor control worthless asset would occur bad actor attack new fork bitcoin built way taking part network far economically incentivized attacking
774,1,key thing understand bitcoin merely us blockchain mean transparently record ledger payment blockchain theory used immutably record number data point discussed could form transaction vote election product inventory state identification deed home much
775,1,currently ten thousand project looking implement blockchains variety way help society recording transactions—for example way vote securely democratic election nature blockchain ’ immutability mean fraudulent voting would become far difficult occur example voting system could work citizen country would issued single cryptocurrency token candidate would given specific wallet address voter would send token crypto address whichever candidate wish vote transparent traceable nature blockchain would eliminate need human vote counting ability bad actor tamper physical ballot
776,1,blockchains heralded disruptive force finance sector especially function payment banking however bank decentralized blockchains vastly different
777,1,know block bitcoin ’ blockchain store data monetary transaction today 10000 cryptocurrency system running blockchain turn blockchain actually reliable way storing data type transaction well
778,1,perhaps industry stand benefit integrating blockchain business operation banking financial institution operate business hour usually five day week mean try deposit check friday 6 pm likely wait monday morning see money hit account even make deposit business hour transaction still take one three day verify due sheer volume transaction bank need settle blockchain hand never sleep
779,1,integrating blockchain bank consumer see transaction processed little 10 minutes—basically time take add block blockchain regardless holiday time day week blockchain bank also opportunity exchange fund institution quickly securely stock trading business example settlement clearing process take three day longer trading internationally meaning money share frozen period time

781,1,spreading operation across network computer blockchain allows bitcoin cryptocurrencies operate without need central authority reduces risk also eliminates many processing transaction fee also give country unstable currency financial infrastructure stable currency application wider network individual institution business domestically internationally
782,1,using cryptocurrency wallet saving account mean payment especially profound state identification country may wartorn government lack real infrastructure provide identification citizen country may access saving brokerage accounts—and therefore way safely store wealth
